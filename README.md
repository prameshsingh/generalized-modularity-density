The example network used here for illustration is the Zachary’s Karate Club network (W. W. Zachary, Journal of Anthropological Research. 33 (4): 452–473 (1977)).


To use the code, follow the steps below:

1. Prepare data

	* 1.1 Use an edgelist file including 3 columns (separated by space or tab with no header) with the last one representing the weight. (If the network is unweighted, just put 1 to the whole column. The network should be undirected. Self-loops will be ignored. See example in karate.txt)
	* 1.2 Use bash script (work.sh) to generate the three files required by the program. 
	* Example:

		`sh work.sh karate.txt` 


2. Compile code

	* 2.1 Make sure the openmp library is installed.
	* 2.2 compile main.c, help.c and rg.c with required libraries (openmp, math).
	* Example:

		`gcc-9 main.c help.c rg.c -fopenmp -lm`

		This will generate file a.out.

3. Run
	run with 6 arguments, respectively as:
	* argument 1: Positive Integer, parameter for Randomized Greedy  (usually 2)
	* argument 2: Positive Integer, ensemble size divided by CPU numbers (It's like this because we use parallel programmming to generate the ensemble faster. Suppose you are using 4 CPU cores and 5 here, your ensemble size will be 4*5=20)
	* argument 3: Positive Integer, ensemble size divided by CPU numbers of partitions of the reduced network for iteration part in RenEEL (Suppose you are using 4 CPU cores and 2 here, your ensemble size during iteration of RenEEL will be 4*2=8)
	* argument 4: Positive Integer, seed for random number generator
	* argument 5: Real number, for parameter $\chi$ in Generalized Modularity Density formula ($\chi$ = 0 for Modularity) (We mainly use $\chi>=0$ to obtain finer structure beyond Modulartiy. But if needed, negative $\chi$ might also be used to obtain coarser sturture than Modularity.)
	* argument 6: Input file name (edgelist), for example `karate.txt`. The file should have already been processed using `work.sh` as described in 1.

	* Example:

		`./a.out 2 5 2 12345 1.0 karate.txt`

4. Collect results

	* file 1: `partition_karate.txt` (or partition_[inputfile])
	* file 2: `results_karate.txt` (or results_[inputfile]), a copy will also be printed to stdout
